# Retrospective: Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Mechanics
Date: 2026-01-11
Participants: Steve (User), Bob (SM), Alice (PO), Charlie (Sr Dev), Elena (Jr Dev), Dana (QA)

## 1. Summary
Epic 1 established the technical and functional foundation of the Music Theory application. We successfully integrated the three core pillars: **Audio** (Tone.js), **Visuals** (VexFlow), and **Interaction** (React/Tailwind UI).

**Status:** 6/6 Stories Completed (100%)

## 2. Key Accomplishments (What went well)
- **Architecture:** The Feature-Folder structure coupled with Zustand for state management has proven scalable.
- **Audio Engine:** The Singleton pattern for `AudioEngine` effectively manages the Tone.js context, solving early initialization challenges.
- **UI/UX:** The "Bamboo" design language (Tailwind v4) provides a distinct, calm aesthetic.
- **Testing:** Achieved 100% pass rate on unit and integration tests for new components.
- **Responsiveness:** The Piano UI handles touch events correctly, supporting both desktop and mobile web.

## 3. Challenges (What was painful)
- **VexFlow Learning Curve:** Handling edge cases like single-note rendering required specific workarounds (`IncompleteVoice`).
- **Build Configuration:** Initial setup with Tailwind v4 and Vitest required careful tuning of `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig` to handle type definitions and file exclusions properly.

## 4. Action Items for Epic 2
- **Maintain Testing Discipline:** Continue the pattern of high test coverage as we enter the data-heavy Sáo Trúc epic.
- **Asset Management:** As we add specific instrument visualizations, ensure assets are optimized to keep the bundle size low (observed in Story 1.5 checks).

## 5. User Feedback
User confirmed satisfaction with progress ("Nothing to say" implies approval of the current state without blocking issues).

## 6. Conclusion
Epic 1 is marked as **DONE**. The foundation is stable and ready for the Sáo Trúc (Bamboo Flute) integration in Epic 2.
