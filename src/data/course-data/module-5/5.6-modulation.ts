## Modulation

**Modulation** is changing from one key to another within a piece.

### Common Modulations

| Type | Target | Used For |
|------|--------|----------|
| Up a half step | Any key | Final chorus lift |
| To relative major/minor | vi or I | Verse to chorus |
| To dominant | V | Development sections |
| To subdominant | IV | Softer contrast |

### Techniques

**Pivot Chord**: A chord that exists in both keys
- C major to G major: D minor is ii in C, iii in G

**Direct Modulation**: Jump to new key without preparation

**Common-Tone Modulation**: Hold one note while harmony changes

### The "Truck Driver's Modulation"
Suddenly shifting up a half step for the final chorus - dramatic but sometimes clichéd!
