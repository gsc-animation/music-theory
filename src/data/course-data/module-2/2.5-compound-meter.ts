## Compound Meter

In **compound meter**, beats are divided into **three** instead of two.

### 6/8 Time
- 6 eighth notes per measure
- But felt as **2 groups of 3**
- Each dotted quarter = 1 beat

### 6/8 vs 3/4
Both have 6 eighth notes per measure, but:
- 3/4: THREE beats (1-2-3, 1-2-3)
- 6/8: TWO beats (1-2-3, 4-5-6)

### Triplets
In simple meter, **triplets** divide a beat into 3 equal parts instead of 2.
